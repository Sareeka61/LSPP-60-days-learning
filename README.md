Here, in this repository you will find some quick and easy conceptual notes on how JS actually works behind the scenes and much more about JavaScript in general.

I am currently following the course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

I also see videos of [Code with Harry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER9SspLe4Hg&list=PLu0W_9lII9ahR1blWXxgSlL4y9iQBnLpR) sometimes.

I absolutely love [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript) for studying about the JS concepts deeply!
