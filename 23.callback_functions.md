# Callbacks

### Asynchronous and Synchronous Actions

- Asynchronous actions are initiated now but finish later.

- Examples of asynchronous actions include setTimeout and AJAX requests.

- Synchronous actions are executed one by one, in order.

### Callback Functions

- A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.

- The outer function invokes the callback function to complete a specific action.

- Callback functions enable asynchronous programming and allow for flexibility and modularity.

Example:
```
function loadScript(src, callback) {
  let script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = src;
  script.onload = () => callback(script);
  document.head.append(script);
}

loadScript('https://google.com', (script) => {
  alert('Script is loaded');
  alert(script.src);
});
```
- In the example above, loadScript is a function that loads an external script asynchronously.

- It takes two parameters: src (source URL of the script) and callback (the function to run after script loading).

- Inside loadScript, the script is created and appended to the document's head.

- When the script finishes loading (onload event), the callback function is invoked with the loaded script as an argument.

- This approach is known as the "Callback-based" style of asynchronous programming.

By utilizing callback functions, we can handle asynchronous operations effectively and specify custom actions to be performed once the operation is completed. This pattern allows for better control flow and the execution of code based on the completion of asynchronous tasks.
