# Regular Expressions in JavaScript (Regex)

Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters used as search patterns in text search and replace operations. They allow you to define complex patterns for finding specific strings or patterns within a larger text.

### Syntax:

Regular expressions are enclosed in forward slashes (/pattern/).
Modifiers can be added after the closing slash to modify the search behavior.

### Example
```
/learn-js/i;
```
### Explanation
```
/learn-js/i  is a regular expression.

learn-js  is a pattern (to be used in a search).

i  is a modifier (modifies the search to be case-insensitive).
```

### String Methods:

**search()** Searches a string for a specified value or regular expression pattern and returns the position of the match.

Example:
```
let text = "Visit Github!";
let n = text.search("Github");
Result: n = 6
```

**replace()** Replaces a specified value or regular expression pattern in a string with another value.

Example:
```
let text = "Visit Home!";
let result = text.replace("Home", "School");
Result: result = "Visit School!"
```

### Modifiers:

Modifiers are used to modify the search behavior of regular expressions.

**Common modifiers**

i: Performs case-insensitive matching.

g: Performs a global match (finds all matches instead of stopping after the first match).

m: Performs multiline matching.

### Regular Expression Patterns:

**Brackets**

[abc]: Finds any of the characters between the brackets.

[0-9]: Finds any digit between 0 and 9.

(x|y): Finds any of the alternatives separated by the pipe symbol (|).

**Metacharacters**

\d: Finds a digit.

\s: Finds a whitespace character.

\b: Finds a match at the beginning or end of a word.

\uxxxx: Finds the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number.

**Quantifiers**

n+: Matches any string that contains at least one occurrence of "n".

n*: Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of "n".

n?: Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrence of "n".

### Using the RegExp Object

The RegExp object in JavaScript has predefined properties and methods for working with regular expressions.

test(): Searches a string for a pattern and returns true if the pattern is found, false otherwise.

exec(): Searches a string for a specified pattern and returns the found text as an object.

Example:
```
const pattern = /e/;
pattern.test("The best things in life are free!");
Result: true
```
