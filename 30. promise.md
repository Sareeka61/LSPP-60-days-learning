# Promise in JS

![promises](assets/promises.png)

- A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

- Promises allow you to handle asynchronous actions and their outcomes by associating handlers with success or failure.

- A Promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

- Pending means the promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.

- Fulfilled means the operation was completed successfully.

- Rejected means the operation failed.

- When a promise is settled (fulfilled or rejected), it cannot change its state further.

- Promises use the then/catch handlers to execute code based on the fulfillment or rejection of the promise.

- The term "resolved" is often used interchangeably with "fulfilled," but resolved promises can also be pending or rejected.

- Promises can be chained together using callback functions.

- Other programming languages also have mechanisms called "promises" for lazy evaluation and deferring computations, but JavaScript promises represent ongoing processes.

- For lazy evaluation in JavaScript, you can use a function with no arguments to create and evaluate expressions immediately.

**Here's a clear example I found on Internet:**
```
//function that returns a Promise
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulate an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from an API)
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = { message: "Data fetched successfully" };
      // Resolve the promise with the data
      resolve(data);
      // Reject the promise with an error
      // reject(new Error("Failed to fetch data"));
    }, 2000); // Simulating a delay of 2 seconds
  });
}

// Call the fetchData function and handle the promise
fetchData()
  .then((result) => {
    // Promise fulfilled, handle the successful result
    console.log(result.message);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Promise rejected, handle the error
    console.log("Error:", error.message);
  });
```
