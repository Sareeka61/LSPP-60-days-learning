# Optional Chaining Operator (?.)

The optional chaining operator (?.) is a feature introduced in JavaScript to simplify accessing properties and calling methods on nested objects when there is a possibility of encountering null or undefined values. It allows you to safely access nested properties without causing an error if any of the intermediate properties are null or undefined.

Key points about the optional chaining operator:

- Safe property access: It provides a concise way to check if a property exists in a chain of nested objects before accessing it.

- Short-circuiting behavior: If any property in the chain is nullish (null or undefined), the expression short-circuits and evaluates to undefined.

- Chaining method calls: It can be used to safely call methods on nested objects without worrying about encountering null or undefined values.

### Syntax:

```
object?.property
object?.method()
```
Example 1: 
Safe property access

```
const user = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John',
  address: {
    street: '123 ABC Street',
    city: 'XYZ',
    // No state property
  }
};

console.log(user.address?.state); // Output: undefined
```
Example 2: Chaining method calls

```
const user = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John',
  getAddress() {
    return this.address?.street + ', ' + this.address?.city;
  }
};

console.log(user.getAddress()); // Output: undefined
```

Example: Using both optional chaining and nullish coalesce operators
```
const users = [];

console.log(users[0]?.name ?? 'users array empty.');

/*The one-lined code above is quivalent to this one below if not used operators: */

if (users.length > 0) console.log(users[0].name);
else console.log('users array empty');
```


## Real-world industry uses of optional chaining operator:

- **Data fetching in APIs:** When working with APIs that return nested data structures, the optional chaining operator can be used to safely access properties without checking for existence at each level. This helps prevent runtime errors if the expected data is missing or incomplete.

- **Front-end development:** In modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular, optional chaining is commonly used in component rendering logic. It allows developers to handle cases where data might not be available yet or has an unexpected structure, ensuring that the application doesn't crash.
