# Short Circuiting in JS (&& and ||)

In JavaScript, the logical operators && (logical AND) and || (logical OR) support a concept known as short-circuiting. Short-circuiting occurs when the result of a logical expression can be determined without evaluating the entire expression. This behavior can be useful for writing concise and efficient code.

### Logical AND (&&):

The logical AND operator (&&) returns true if both operands are truthy. If the first operand is falsy, the expression short-circuits and immediately returns the falsy value without evaluating the second operand.

If the first operand is truthy, the expression continues to evaluate the second operand. If the second operand is truthy, the entire expression evaluates to true. Otherwise, it evaluates to the falsy value of the second operand.

Here's an example:
```
let a = 5;
let b = 10;
let result = a > 0 && b > 0;
console.log(result); // Output: true
```

In this example, both a and b are greater than 0, so the second operand is evaluated, and the result is true.

### Logical OR (||):

The logical OR operator (||) returns true if at least one of the operands is truthy. If the first operand is truthy, the expression short-circuits and immediately returns the truthy value without evaluating the second operand.

If the first operand is falsy, the expression continues to evaluate the second operand. If the second operand is truthy, the entire expression evaluates to true. Otherwise, it evaluates to the falsy value of the second operand.

Here's an example:

```
let a = 5;
let b = 0;
let result = a > 0 || b > 0;
console.log(result); // Output: true
```

In this example, a is greater than 0, so the second operand is not evaluated, and the result is true.

Short-circuiting can be useful in various scenarios, such as conditional statements, default values, and avoiding potential errors. 

It allows you to write concise code by taking advantage of the fact that the evaluation stops as soon as the result is determined.
