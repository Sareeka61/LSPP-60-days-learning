# Keyed Collections - I

The collections of data which are indexed by a key like Maps and Sets are keyed collections. 

## Maps

- A Map object is a collection of key/value pairs where the keys can be of any value type.
 
- It allows you to store and retrieve values based on their associated keys.

- You can iterate over the elements of a Map in the order of their insertion.

Example from the docs that clearly illustrates the operations on Maps: 
```
const sayings = new Map();
sayings.set("dog", "woof");
sayings.set("cat", "meow");
sayings.set("elephant", "toot");

sayings.size; // 3
sayings.get("dog"); // "woof"
sayings.get("fox"); // undefined
sayings.has("bird"); // false
sayings.delete("dog");
sayings.has("dog"); // false

for (const [key, value] of sayings) {
  console.log(`${key} goes ${value}`);
}
// Output:
// "cat goes meow"
// "elephant goes toot"

sayings.clear();
sayings.size; // 0
```
- Map objects provide advantages over traditional objects when the keys are unknown until runtime, when all keys and values are of the same type, or when you need to easily determine the size of the collection.

## Weakmaps

- A WeakMap is a collection of key/value pairs where the keys must be objects or non-registered symbols.

- Unlike regular Map objects, the presence of an object used as a key in a WeakMap does not prevent the object from being garbage collected.

- WeakMap values can be of any JavaScript type.

- WeakMaps do not support enumeration or obtaining a list of keys.

- Example use case: Storing private data for an object or hiding implementation details.

Example from MDN web docs:
```
const privates = new WeakMap();

function Public() {
  const me = {
    // Private data goes here
  };
  privates.set(this, me);
}

Public.prototype.method = function () {
  const me = privates.get(this);
  // Do stuff with private data in `me`
  // ...
};

module.exports = Public;
```

- In this example, the private data and methods of an object are stored in a WeakMap called privates, ensuring they are inaccessible from the outside world.
