# Functions returning functions in JS


- In JavaScript, functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions.

- Functions that return other functions are called higher-order functions.

- Returning a function creates a closure, which captures the variables and values from the outer function.

- Higher-order functions are useful for creating reusable code and implementing concepts like function currying and closures.

- Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for defining functions that return functions.

- Higher-order functions enable you to create flexible and modular code structures.

Here's a example of functions returning functions in JS:
```
function createGreeting(greeting) {
  return function(name) {
    return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
  };
}

const sayHello = createGreeting('Hello');
const sayHi = createGreeting('Hi');

console.log(sayHello('Sarika')); // Output: Hello, Sarika!
console.log(sayHi('Sita')); // Output: Hi, Sita!
```

One real-life use case of functions returning functions in the industry is in the realm of middleware in web development. Middleware functions are functions that sit between the request and response objects in web applications, allowing for additional processing and manipulation of data.
