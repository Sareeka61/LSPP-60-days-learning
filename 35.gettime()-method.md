# gettime() method in JS

The gettime() method of date returns total number of milliseconds passed till date since the UNIX epoch time.

*Unix epoch time is basically defined to be the midnight at the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC(Coordinated Universal Time).*

## Need of gettime() in JS

- Gives a numeric representation of a moment in time.

- Enables precise calculations and comparisons of dates.

- Supports time-based operations and scheduling.

- Ensures interoperability across platforms.

- Forms the foundation for date and time handling in JavaScript.

## Syntax
```
Date.getTime();
```

## Understanding with Example

```
var date = new Date();

var x = date.getTime();

var currentDate = date.toLocaleDateString();
document.write(currentDate);
//output: 7/9/2023
```
```
var minutes = 1000 * 60;
var hours = minutes * 60;
var days = hours * 24;
var years = days * 365;

var y = Math.round(x / minutes);

console.log(y); //output: 28148704
```
 
Let's understand this code: 

```var date = new Date();```: This line creates a new Date object and assigns it to variable 'date'. The Date object represents the current date and time.

```var x = date.getTime();```: Here, the 'getTime()' method is called on the date object to retrieve the current time as a timestamp. THe timestamp is stored in variable 'x'.

```var currentDate = date.toLocaleDateString();```: This line uses the 'toLocaleDateString()' method to format the current date as a string based on the user's local settings. The formatted date is stored in the variable 'currentDate'.

```document.write(currentDate);```: This line writes the value of currentDate to the document. It displays the formatted current date on the webpage.

To know how many minutes,days, years has passed since UNIX epoch:

```var minutes = 1000 * 60;```: This line calculates the number of milliseconds in one minute. It multiplies 1000 (milliseconds in a second) by 60 (seconds in a minute) to get the value of minutes.

```var hours = minutes * 60;```: Here, minutes is multiplied by 60 to calculate the number of milliseconds in one hour. The result is stored in the variable hours.

```var days = hours * 24;```: This line calculates the number of milliseconds in one day by multiplying hours by 24. The result is stored in the variable days.

```var years = days * 365;```: Here, days is multiplied by 365 to calculate the number of milliseconds in one year (assuming a non-leap year). The result is stored in the variable years.

You can calculate the timestamp using any of minutes, hours, days. Let's try to calculate timestamp dividing with minutes in the example.

```var y = Math.round(x / minutes);```: This line divides the timestamp x by minutes and rounds the result to the nearest whole number using the Math.round() function. The rounded value is stored in the variable y.

```console.log(y);```: Finally, the value of y is printed to the console.

In summary, this code retrieves the current time as a timestamp using getTime(), formats the current date using toLocaleDateString(), and calculates the number of minutes since the Unix epoch. The result is rounded and printed to the console. The code also writes the formatted current date to the document.
