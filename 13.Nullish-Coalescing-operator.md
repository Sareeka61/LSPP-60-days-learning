#  Nullish Coalescing Operator in JavaScript

The nullish coalescing operator (??) is a powerful addition to JavaScript that allows for concise and effective handling of null or undefined values. It provides a convenient way to check if a value is null or undefined and assign a default value in such cases. This note will cover the key concepts and usage of the nullish coalescing operator, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of this essential JavaScript feature.

- The nullish coalescing operator (??) is represented by two consecutive question marks.
```
Syntax:
leftExpr ?? rightExpr
```

- It provides a shorthand syntax to check if the value on the left-hand side (LHS) is nullish (null or undefined).

- If the LHS value is nullish, the operator returns the value on the right-hand side (RHS). Otherwise, it returns the LHS value.

## Comparision with: 
### 1. The OR (||) Operator:
The OR operator can be used for assigning a default value when the LHS is falsy, including values like empty strings (''), 0, false, null, and undefined.

However, it also assigns a default value for falsy values, which may not be desired when explicitly checking for null or undefined.

The nullish coalescing operator, on the other hand, only checks for null or undefined, making it more specific and reliable.

### 2. The Ternary Operator (? : ):
The ternary operator can be used to check for null or undefined values and assign a default value, but it involves writing more code.

The nullish coalescing operator offers a more concise and readable alternative, especially when dealing with multiple variables or complex expressions.

### Examples:
```
const value = null ?? 'default';
console.log(value);  // Output: 'default'
```
The nullish coalescing operator checks if the value is null or undefined and assigns the default value 'default' in case it is.

## Potential Use Cases:

### 1. Function Parameters:
- The nullish coalescing operator is commonly used when working with function parameters that have optional or default values.

- It enables developers to handle missing or undefined arguments by assigning default values within the function's signature.

### 2. Object Property Access:
- When accessing properties within an object, the nullish coalescing operator can help provide fallback values for properties that might not exist or have null/undefined values.
