# Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy in JS

Cloning an object in JS is not similar experience to cloning a variable in JS.

If we assign one object to another object then the data is not copied but the reference[memory location] is copied.

## Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy 

In shallow copy, only first level of objects are copied. In deep copy, all levels i.e. nested objects are also copied.

## Problem 
```
let obj = {
  name: "sarika",
};

let user = obj;
user.name = "siddanta";

console.log(obj); //siddanta
console.log(user); //siddanta
```

## Shallow Copy
There are two ways we can do shallow copying in JS.

1. Using Object.assign( ) 
2. Using spread operator(...)

### Using object.assign( ) 
```
let obj = {
    name: "sarika",
};

let user = object.assign({}, obj);
  
user.name = "siddanta";

console.log("object is: ", obj); // Object is sarika
console.log("User is: ", user); // User is siddanta
```

### Using spread operator(...)
```
let obj = {
    name: "sarika",
};
  
let user = { ...obj };
  
user.name = "siddanta";

console.log("object is: ", obj); // Object is sarika
console.log("User is: ", user); // User is siddanta
```

## Deep Copy
```
let obj = {
  name: "sarika",
  address: {
    city: "Pokhara",
    country: "Nepal",
  },
};

let user = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));

user.name = "siddanta";
user.address.city = "Kathmandu";

console.log("object is: ", obj); //Object is: name: "sarika", address: "Pokhara"

console.log("User is: ", user);  //User is: name: "siddanta", address: "Kathmandu"
```

**Limitation:** 
You can not copy functions and dates/times using deep copy.

### When to use which copy?
- When you have to copy nested objects, use deep copy otherwise, use shallow copy.
